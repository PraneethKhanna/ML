The objective is to create a machine-learning model for house price predictons.
The data-set is from kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data" 

Dataset contains 1460 rows and 81 columns describing each feature associated with house pricing.
The model is based on KNNregressor and evaluated using r2_score and RMSE values


Prerequisites: 
Install anaconda on system and launch spyder.
Setup & RUN: 
1)Download the "house_predictions.py" file and "House_train.csv" file.
2)Set the pd.read_csv to the file location where "House_train.csv" is downloaded.
3)Run the file.

Anomalies:
The model doesn't predict outliers properly.
