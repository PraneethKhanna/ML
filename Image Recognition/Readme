Detecting "Temoc"- UTD mascot on live video.
Using SURF features to make a KMEANS machine learning model.
Steps:
1.Extract features  from images,
2.Create bag of Vocabulary,
3.Cluster the features,
4.Fit the features to machine learning model,
5.Predicting the temoc on live video. 
 
Setup:
install anaconda
pip install opencv-contrib-python
Download Temoc images from my github

Run: 
Change directories for training images and testing video file.

Dataset consists of Temoc images which are cropped after downloaded from google/images and  
negative sample consists of images of cars, leopards, etc...

A (3x3) window search is done on the video frame to track the estimated position of temoc.
Which results in rise of complexity and delay of video frames.
